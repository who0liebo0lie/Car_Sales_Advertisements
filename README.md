# Car Sales Advertisements 
This project will cover software development skills.  Task accomplished are to use Visual Code Studio to review a .csv file, remove duplicates, and clean out empty columns.  The data will be reviewed for trends between key elements. This created program is a tool to simulate random events.  Tool will use pandas, numpy, Plotly Express, GitHub, and Render. 

Following is a summary of some information explored: 
A comparision between the types of gas effect the price.  
Is there a price difference between manufacturers? 
Does the age of the color influence the price? 

All code will then be committed and pushed to the GitHub repository where it will be accessible to other users.  The code will be utilized in Render to create interactive plots. 

The render link is https://sprint4project-o0n1.onrender.com

App will enable a filter for car manufacturers to with beginning and ending years of cars listed for sale. A table will be generated to show all of the listings made in the ad sales records. 

Used car price analysis is available. A visual is generated to show which factors influence price the most: transmission,fuel,body type or running condition. There are outliers for each of the categories. A visual silt is shown as well for price effect by odometer, cylinders, or condition.
